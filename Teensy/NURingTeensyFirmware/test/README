This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

## Program flow

#  Setup
- Begin Amplifier interface 
- Start amplifier timer

# Program loop
- Read value from load cell
- Calculate control values
- Map control values to amplifier PWM

# Amplifier timer
- Drive amplifier



## Class information

# T_AmplifierClass.cpp          - Contains functions for driving the amplifiers / motors
Begin()     Initializes the amplifiers
Enable()    Enables the amplifier output
DrivePWM()  Sends the actual PWM values into the amplifiers (0 = full forward, 2048 = zero power, 4096 = full reverse)

# T_SharedDataManagerClass.h  - contains all global variables
